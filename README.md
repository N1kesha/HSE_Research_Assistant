# HSE Research Assistant Job

This is the code I wrote during my Research Assistant job in the Faculty of Economic Sciences in HSE. It has computed over 70 statistical indices, 
which professors asked me to construct, for 3000 regions all over the world using tabular and geo-spatial data. Primarily using ArcPy library and ArcGIS software.
